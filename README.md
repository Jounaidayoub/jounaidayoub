# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ayoub, I am a software engineering student. I do fullstack development and I am kind of interested more toward backend stuff . I also enjoy low-level programming . I love tinkering with computers and tech, from Linux and scripting to LLMs and their applications.


- I love exploring how things work under the hood ( remove the magic )
- ðŸ’» Working on Something special ;)
- ðŸ“« Check my porfolio: ayooub.me 

Abstraction = Bad (until u peel it and see whats inside , at leeast once )
